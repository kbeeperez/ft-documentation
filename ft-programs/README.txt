This folder contains three different programs which are needed to control the factory simualtion:
- Multi-Processing_Station.rpp has to run on the master controller (blue LED) of the multi processing station with oven
- Sorting_Line.rpp has to run on the controller of the sorting line
- Warehouse+Gripper has to run on the master controller (LED) of the high-bay warehouse 

The controller of the vacuum gripper robot is an extension of the warehouse and needs no extra program in order to work!
